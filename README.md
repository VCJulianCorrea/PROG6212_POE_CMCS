# PROG6212 POE - Contract Monthly Claim System
This is a project where I had to create a CMCS for Lecturers to upload their claims and documents for coordinators and managers to review.

## What I did for Part 1
I made a UML Diagram, some documentation, a project plan, and a basic GUI of the system, which didn't turn out great.

## Part 2
I added 3 views, one for each role, to view the claims. The uploader has been made with the inclusion of documentation, hours worked and hourly rate. In the Coordinators and Managers views, there is a verify and approve button for each claims respectfully, as well as a reject button for both tables. It also only allows Lecturers to delete their claims. The conditions of the claim, whether it is being reviewed and verified, can be viewed by all 3 roles from their respective views. The System overall is much more neater and more colorful too!

## What changed from Part 1
The 3 views have now been added, more detail is added to the GUI, there is now a button for lecturers to submit their claims and the coordinators and managers can now easily approve and verify the claims thanks to the added buttons.
